        <p>
          I’m very passionate about photography. However, throughout the years I
          stopped doing it as much as I used to. Recently however, I’ve
          purchased a new camera and equipment and I’m falling in love with the
          craft all over again. I’ve even started to dabble in videography.

      <!-- BRUNCH -->
      <div id="brUnch">
        <h2>Brunch</h2>
        <p>
          I love food, I’m sure someone else is going to say that, because most
          people love food. However, I enjoy brunch the most. Brunch is not only
          about eating breakfast at any time of the day, it’s also about
          socializing with the people who are most important to you.

        <p>
          Fall is my favorite time of year. Mainly because Fall involves all of
          my favorite colors: Olive green, burnt orange and, mustard yellow.
          Also, I do love the fall drink selections when it comes to Starbucks.
          Not to mention the fall selection when it comes to Bath and Bodyworks.

        <h2>Fragrances</h2>
        <p>
          Speaking of bath and Bodyworks, I am a fragrance connoisseur. I
          collect different perfumes and candles. My favorite candle is teakwood
          mahogany intense from Bath and Bodyworks and my favorite fall
          fragrance to wear is a Tom Ford black orchid. It’s considered to be a
          woman’s fragrance, but most people would say it’s unisex.

        <p>
          I have approximately six tattoos. One is a very ugly hand on the
          inside of my arm. The only way to see it is if I show it to you. I’m
          not going to show it to you because it’s ugly. The only reason I got
          it is because my ex girlfriend was getting her first tattoo, and told
          me she was scared. So the tattoo artist next to the artist giving her
          a tattoo offered to give me a tattoos so she wouldn’t have to endure
          the pain alone. We broke up years later.

      <!-- WATCH SECTION -->
      <div id="watcheS">
        <h2>Watches</h2>
        <p>
          Lastly, a very unhealthy have hobby of mines is watch collecting.
          Currently, I own eight watches. My most expensive watch would be my
          Cartier tank. It was a watch that I saved up quite a while for and
          cost me a little over $2000. My grail watch would be either the
          Cartier Crash or the Cheich. The only downside of owning watches from
          Cartier is that they don't retain value. Unlike the two watches I
          mentioned earlier, unless you own a Patek Philippe or Rolex, your
          watch really isn't retaining value. Nevertheless, I do favor Cartier
          over all other watch brands.
