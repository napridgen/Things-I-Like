    <p>
      I’m very passionate about photography. However, throughout the years I
      stopped doing it as much as I used to. Recently however, I’ve purchased a
      new camera and equipment and I’m falling in love with the craft all over
      again. I’ve even started to dabble in videography.

    <h2>Brunch</h2>
    <p>
      I love food, I’m sure someone else is going to say that, because most
      people love food. However, I enjoy brunch the most. Brunch is not only
      about eating breakfast at any time of the day, it’s also about socializing
      with the people who are most important to you.

    <h2>Fall</h2>

    <p>
      Fall is my favorite time of year. Mainly because Fall involves all of my
      favorite colors: Olive green, burnt orange and, mustard yellow. Also, I do
      love the fall drink selections when it comes to Starbucks. Not to mention
      the fall selection when it comes to Bath and Bodyworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Fragrances</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking of bath and Bodyworks, I am a fragrance connoisseur. I collect
      different perfumes and candles. My favorite candle is teakwood mahogany
      intense from Bath and Bodyworks and my favorite fall fragrance to wear is
      a Tom Ford black orchid. It’s considered to be a woman’s fragrance, but
      most people would say it’s unisex.
    </p>
    <h2>Tattoos</h2>

    <p>
      I have approximately six tattoos. One is a very ugly hand on the inside of
      my arm. The only way to see it is if I show it to you. I’m not going to
      show it to you because it’s ugly. The only reason I got it is because my
      ex girlfriend was getting her first tattoo, and told me she was scared. So
      the tattoo artist next to the artist giving her a tattoo offered to give
      me a tattoos so she wouldn’t have to endure the pain alone. We broke up
      years later.

    <h2>Watches</h2>
    <p>
      Lastly, a very unhealthy have hobby of mines is watch collecting.
      Currently, I own eight watches. My most expensive watch would be my
      Cartier tank. It was a watch that I saved up quite a while for and cost me
      a little over $2000. My grail watch would be either the Cartier Crash or
      the Cheich. The only downside of owning watches from Cartier is that they
      don't retain value. Unlike the two watches I mentioned earlier, unless you
      own a Patek Philippe or Rolex, your watch really isn't retaining value.
      Nevertheless, I do favor Cartier over all other watch brands.
