    <h2>Photography</h2>

    <p>
      I’m very passionate about photography. However, throughout the years I
      stopped doing it as much as I used to. Recently however, I’ve purchased a
      new camera and equipment and I’m falling in love with the craft all over
      again. I’ve even started to dabble in videography.

    <h2>Brunch</h2>
    <p>
      I love food, I’m sure someone else is going to say that, because most
      people love food. However, I enjoy brunch the most. Brunch is not only
      about eating breakfast at any time of the day, it’s also about socializing
      with the people who are most important to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Fall</h2>

    <p>
      Fall is my favorite time of year. Mainly because Fall involves all of my
      favorite colors: Olive green, burnt orange and, mustard yellow. Also, I do
      love the fall drink selections when it comes to Starbucks. Not to mention
      the fall selection when it comes to Bath and Bodyworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Fragrances</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking of bath and Bodyworks, I am a fragrance connoisseur. I collect
      different perfumes and candles. My favorite candle is teakwood mahogany
      intense from Bath and Bodyworks and my favorite fall fragrance to wear is
      a Tom Ford black orchid. It’s considered to be a woman’s fragrance, but
      most people would say it’s unisex.
    </p>
    <h2>Tattoos</h2>

      alt="Photo of insde of a local tattoo shop"
    />
    <p>
      I have approximately six tattoos. One is a very ugly hand on the inside of
      my arm. The only way to see it is if I show it to you. I’m not going to
      show it to you because it’s ugly. The only reason I got it is because my
      ex girlfriend was getting her first tattoo, and told me she was scared. So
      the tattoo artist next to the artist giving her a tattoo offered to give
      me a tattoos so she wouldn’t have to endure the pain alone. We broke up
      years later.

    <h2>Random Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly, I can’t think of anything else to tell about myself. So I
      thought it be nice to give some fun facts. First, it is impossible to kill
      yourself by holding your breath. Second, if you sneeze too hard, you can
      actually fracture a rib. And lastly, the name of all of the continents
      ends with the same letter that they start with excluding the north and the
      south of north and South America. Below this paragraph you’ll find a
      random unordered list of all the continents.
